A primary-replica cluster, often referred to as a master-slave or primary-replica replication setup, is a configuration used in database systems where data is replicated from a primary (master) database server to one or more secondary (replica) servers. This setup is commonly employed for various reasons, including scalability, fault tolerance, and redundancy.

In a primary-replica cluster:

Primary Server (Master):

The primary server is the main database server where all write operations (insert, update, delete) take place.
It manages the original copy of the data and is responsible for accepting write requests from applications.
Replica Server(s) (Slave):

Replica servers are secondary database servers that receive replicated data from the primary server.
They serve as read-only copies of the primary database and are used to offload read queries, improving performance by distributing the workload.
These replicas can also act as failover points in case the primary server encounters issues.
In the context of MySQL, setting up a primary-replica configuration involves configuring the MySQL replication feature. This typically includes:

Enabling binary logging on the primary server to record changes made to the database.
Configuring the replica server(s) to connect to the primary server and replicate data changes from the primary's binary logs.
Ensuring proper synchronization and monitoring to maintain data consistency between the primary and replica servers.
Setting up MySQL replication involves specific steps and configurations outlined in MySQL's documentation or various tutorials available online. It's crucial to handle configurations and monitoring carefully to prevent data inconsistencies or replication lag between the primary and replica servers.

If you're interested in learning more, I'd recommend checking out MySQL's official documentation on replication setup, as well as online tutorials and guides that provide step-by-step instructions for implementing a primary-replica cluster with MySQL.
