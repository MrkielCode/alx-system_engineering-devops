## Web Server Overview

A web server's primary role is to handle incoming requests from clients, delivering web resources in response to those requests.

## Child Processes

A child process is created by another process (known as the parent process) and often performs specific tasks independently, allowing for parallel execution.

## Parent and Child Processes in Web Servers

Web servers typically use a parent-child process model for scalability. The parent process manages core functionality, while child processes handle incoming client requests concurrently.

## HTTP Requests

The main HTTP request methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, used to retrieve, send, update, or delete resources on a server.

## DNS Overview

DNS stands for Domain Name System, translating domain names into IP addresses, facilitating internet communication.

## DNS Record Types

- **A Record (Address Record):** Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.
- **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):** Creates an alias for a domain name.
- **TXT Record (Text Record):** Stores text-based information for various purposes.
- **MX Record (Mail Exchange Record):** Specifies the mail server responsible for a domain.

This repository aims to provide a foundational understanding of these concepts, facilitating learning about web servers and DNS in the context of internet technologies.
